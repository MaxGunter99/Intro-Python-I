what a beautiful day, a care free happy day, one that youll want to relive again and again. you can try remembering this day on your own, but for some reason ... you cant piece it all together. You can try drawing it, but lets face it, your hardly an artist. You can try coming back to the same spot, with the same people, only to find that your older, crankier, and the entire area has been bombarded with nucular missiles. In fact these days, theres only one way to save a perfect summer day, its with pictures! Use Kodak cameras to save all your best days, because it will only get worse from here.
